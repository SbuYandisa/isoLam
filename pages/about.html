                                Founded by a group of students who encountered diverse challenges throughout their academic journeys, 
                                this initiative emerged from their collective experiences. Through mutual support from high school 
                                to university, their objective is to positively influence the lives of fellow learners, facilitating a 
                                more assured and practical navigation of both academic and career paths.

                                    <p>Navigating the selection of a suitable career path is a complex endeavor, as the choices made invariably
                                        influence one's life trajectory. Many learners find themselves compelled to either take a agap year or persue
                                        courses at higher institutions that do not align with their true passions. This often arises from a lack of proper
                                        guidance, leading to instances of student dropout, academic exclusion, and the attaainment of qualifications that do not
                                        resonate with personal interests. in repsonse to these challenges, Isolam was established by a collective of individuals who
                                        underwent similar experiences during their academic journeys. Drawing from their mutual support system, cultivated through high
                                        school and university. The organisation is committed to effecting positve change in the lives of other students.
